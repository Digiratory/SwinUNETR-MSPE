## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you don't have write access, fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the GitHub page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork (or the main repository if you have access) to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SwinUNETR-MSPE.git
   cd StatTools
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the package in editable mode along with development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks**: Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Write Code**: Make your changes following the coding standards below.
2. **Run Pre-Commit**: Before committing, run pre-commit to check your code:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. **Test Your Changes**: Run the test suite to ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**: Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub.

### Coding Standards

- **Code Formatting**: Use Black for code formatting and isort for import sorting. These are enforced by pre-commit hooks.
- **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8 conventions.
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings to new functions and classes. Update documentation as needed.
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints where appropriate.

### Commit Messages

For detailed information about the format, types, scope, breaking changes, and examples, please refer to the official specification at: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

### Testing

- Write tests for new features in the `tests/` directory.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Run tests locally: `python -m pytest tests/`

## Pull Requests

- Provide a clear description of the changes.
- Reference any related issues.
- Ensure CI checks pass.
- Request review from maintainers.

## Issues and Bugs

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or suggest features.
- Provide detailed information: steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment details.
- Check existing issues before creating new ones.

## Additional Resources

- [README.md](README.md) for project overview and usage examples.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.
